Here we find that PHPS are used in this website. We know this because when we look at the robots.txt file we see that there is admin.phps. Next I will try to find more phps files here.

I discovered that the index.php has index.phps that revealed the script that is running on the background. I found two additional scripts the authentication script and cookie script. Looking at it I cant really see anything useful so i go to a write up.

There I learned about php serialized object vulnerability where magic funtions (denoted by __) is ran without calling it. Some examples would be __construct which runs at the instantiation of object(when unserializing an object it is instantiated so beware of this!!!), __to_string this is ran when printing the object.

So to solve this one I need to create a serialized object of class log_access and make use of the __to_string.
